Objective

As a user, I should be able 
to generate short links for long urls ( many short link per long url per user)
See analytics
Clicks on a specific short URL by day, by hour etc.
Clicks on the long URL aggregated from all short urls pointed to it. Note that one long url may have many short urls
Analytics may also include aggregation of date/time of click, ip, location, user agent etc. The more the better...
